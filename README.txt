Welcome to the program that takes in a picture and analyzes the number of hits and misses for a given picture.
It run two different simulations FIFO and INFINITE memory. Fifo has a limit size, while infinite memory assumes unlimited memory.
This is a simulation to analyze a virtual memory paging system given a certain number of memory accesses and a certain amount of 
available memory.

HOWTORUN:
1. Type in "make" and this complies the program for you. it creates an executable called hw3.
2. Do command "./hw3" followed by a picture. Ive included the pictures I've tested in my folder. So you can 
run "./hw3 calibration.nz" or "./hw3 Chevalier_473.nz".
3. The program takes two more arguements, the memoryAccess and frametablesize.
4. Example to run code with all four arguements "./hw3 calibration.nz 0 256"
